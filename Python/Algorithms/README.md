## BackTrackingAlgorithms

Backtracking is a technique based on algorithm to solve problem. It uses recursive calling to find the solution by building a solution step by step increasing values with time. It removes the solutions that doesn't give rise to the solution of the problem based on the constraints given to solve the problem.

## DeepLearningAlgorithms

Deep learning algorithms run data through several “layers” of neural network algorithms, each of which passes a simplified representation of the data to the next layer. Most machine learning algorithms work well on datasets that have up to a few hundred features, or columns.

## DivideAndConquer

Both merge sort and quicksort employ a common algorithmic paradigm based on recursion. This paradigm, divide-and-conquer, breaks a problem into subproblems that are similar to the original problem, recursively solves the subproblems, and finally combines the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem

## DynamicPrograming

Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later.


## GreedyAlgorithms

A greedy algorithm is a simple, intuitive algorithm that is used in optimization problems. The algorithm makes the optimal choice at each step as it attempts to find the overall optimal way to solve the entire problem.

## MachineLearningAlgorithms

To recap, we have covered some of the the most important machine learning algorithms for data science: 5 supervised learning techniques- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, CART, Naïve Bayes, KNN. 3 unsupervised learning techniques- Apriori, K-means, PCA.
